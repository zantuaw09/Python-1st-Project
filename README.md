This project is a graphic-based Python program that involves sorting different library books via their distinct call numbers. The project was developed over the course of 4 weeks for Temple's Introduction to Python course (CIS 1051).

In order to run this program, the free online library called "Pygame" must be installed. Click below to learn more and download the most recent package (1.9.6) using pip install:

A Python compiler software is also needed to run this program. More detailed information instructing the uses of this program will be added as the game is updated.

To play the game, open the folder "ReShelved Project" in this repository. The Python file labeled "Reshelved Pygame" is the file to be run.
