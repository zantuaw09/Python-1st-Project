# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ReShelved - Library Book Speed Sorting

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An informative game that involves quickly reorganizing book stacks based on their call numbers, akin to educational typing games.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning on double-dipping final projects with other courses.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A (planning on working alone)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Function that sorts a list of strings based on Library of Congress call number system (must implement rules!)
- Randomly generate valid book call numbers in mixed order
- Check accuracy of player's input for a shelf to the correct list

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Allow player to directly change order of books in list
- ***USING PYGAME***, develop custom graphics of physical books with call numbers, allowing for visual reorganization on-screen
- Design timer to track how fast books were reorganized

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Add fluid "physics" of book sprite movements; i.e., books realistically *shift* when a book is placed in a new spot
- Add possible difficulty settings (number of shelves and books)
- 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- Learn how to use and apply 'pygame' modules
- Apply graphics or sprites to create interactive buttons and visuals?
- Make concise sorting function of call number inputs
