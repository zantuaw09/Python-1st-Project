Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Learned much of the basic and fundamental functions of PYGAME such as creating a gameplay loop, placing different surfaces onto the screen, and detecting collisions through rectangles. I have also planned out my ideas for implementing the book ID system that generates a list of call numbers to be organized in a set "right order".

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to properly code and test at least TWO distinct functions that will create vaild call numbers and organize 5 into a chronological "answer list". I will also need to allow the movement of the book surfaces in my game to simutaneously adjust a "player list" that will check accuracy based on the "answer list".

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Found some challenge in developing a fluid interface for the game and movement of surfaces -- i.e. the programming of motions like sliding books on shelves and actions like switching positions with other books. Some of my initial ideas on how the game will be played have changed to best accomodate with the tools provided by pygame.

As I continue development, especially as I shift focus towards programming the call number system of the game, I will need to continue refining this portion of the game and make it as intuitive as possible to make playing the game feel easy to pick up.
