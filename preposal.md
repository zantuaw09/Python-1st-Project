# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Clicker game with betting/gambling for better scores (apply Monte-Carlo)
- Sorting tool or game involving library call numbers?
- Any game programmed on calculator?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?

What extent can we refer to the internet or other CS-relevant resources to get inspiration (not copy ideas) for project concepts?

Would you say a more practical application is better for this project or more trivial to reflect the level of skills we have in coding?
