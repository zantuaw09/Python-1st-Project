# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Sorting tool for library book call numbers -- displays current stack of books in real time with graphics?
- Clicker game with betting/gambling for better scores (apply Monte-Carlo)
- Choose-your-own-adventure/murder mystery game that prevents you from winning
- Program a game on a calculator?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

If not working alone, John Currie or Ian Thorpe

## Do you have any questions of your own?

What extent can we refer to the internet or other CS-relevant resources to get inspiration (not copy ideas) for concepts and further refinements throughout our project?
